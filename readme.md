# My Homebrew Formulae

## Installation

Install a formula

```bash
brew install alberto-lazari/formulae/<formula>
```

Otherwise you can manually tap in

```bash
brew tap alberto-lazari/formulae
```

And then just
```bash
brew install <formula>
```

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "alberto-lazari/formulae"
brew "<formula>"
```
